# Project Context: MTGA Card Ordering Game

## Goal

Build a web-based learning tool that helps players memorize MTGA card ratings from 17Lands. Users improve through repetition by ordering cards from highest to lowest based on "ever_drawn_win_rate".

## User flow

1. Page loads with 5 random cards from the current draft set.
2. User drags and drops cards to order them.
3. User submits their guess.
4. App shows the correct order and each card’s rating.
5. User clicks a button to start a new round with 5 different random cards.

## Data

- Source: https://www.17lands.com/card_ratings/data?expansion={set_code}&format=premierdraft
- Set code is fixed to the current draft set.
- Data should be cached on the server for at most 1 hour.
- No direct client fetch from 17Lands — must go through server cache.

## Tech stack

- Next.js 14 with App Router
- Hosted on Vercel
- Drag-and-drop with React DnD or similar
- Server component for fetching cached data
- Desktop layout only in first version

## Constraints

- No scoring, achievements, or timers in first version
- No sound effects or music
- Start immediately — minimal instructions
- After showing correct order, user presses a button to go to the next round
